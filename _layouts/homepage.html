					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I am a frontend designer and engineer specializing in creative website and user interface solutions. I have a wide array of experience from working with digital agencies to working with emerging SaaS marketing solutions. </p>
					<p>My journey into the world of design began in photography, in the dark room of my high school where I learned the beauty of unique composition and the simplicity of seeing the world in black and white. My passion for technology led me into the world of frontend engineering where I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and javascript. I specialize in responsive website and UI development for businesses large and small. I am experienced in CMS development as well as front end MVC frameworks such and React and AngularJS.</p>
					<p>My expertise and passion lives in the frontend, where I can blur the line that separates the machine from the visceral. From time to time I still break out the camera as you will see my work adorning this site running on top of a web experience that is uniquely me.</p>
