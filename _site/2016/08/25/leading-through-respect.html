<h1 id="leading-through-respect">Leading Through Respect</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it.” – Dwight D. Eisenhower</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has become a cliche to say there are two ways to lead, one is through fear, the other is through respect. Unless you are the head of a slave labor force, or somehow find yourself running an insane asylum complete with a large indian, a stuttering momma’s boy, and an Irish leatherneck–fear will never be a viable leadership strategy. The focus of this essay is respect, because many a leader has found them self pondering this cliche, all the while pondering <em>but how do I gain this elusive respect?</em> In my experience I have seen two major ways the best managers gain the respect of their workforce, and a failure to master one of these two leads the team open to a subtle mutiny.</p>

<p>The first is the easiest to spot and understand. This type of leader garners the respect of their team through their resume. Their prior accomplishments speak for themselves and to an outsider, they gain the respect of their team based upon where they have been. For instance if you are a designer you may ask for the opinion of your peers and weigh their opinions against your own, however if Jony Ive were to supply you with feedback you may be more inclined to follow it. If someone has been down the road you are hoping to travel, and with wild or even moderate success, you would be wise to follow their lead. However, this type of leader didn’t just emerge from their mother’s womb with a kickass resume that garners the respect and admiration of their peers. You would also be write to criticize as hyperbolic an example as Jony Ive. Many leaders that we work with every day have modest resumes still in their infancy. Most leaders had to learn to lead long before they were ready, and it is a common mistake to attempt to replicate the behavior of the perceived master of their trade, descending to the role of the frustrated boss rather than the calm savant they were hoping to be.</p>

<p>What then is the missing factor? Unwavering belief in the team itself. A team that finds itself trusted immensely and counted on becomes poised for high performance. A leader that shows belief in their team will find respect comes easy, and success frequent. More importantly it’s easier to build those accomplishments when the team is behind you. No one can do it all themselves. The issue with the above is it’s often easier to say “I believe in my team,” than to show it. In order for the team to know it, it must be more than just said, it must permeate the fabric of the organization. It has to <em>feel</em> like a fact, not merely stated. In my own experience there are a few ways in which my favorite leaders have all shown this.</p>

<p><strong>1. Never use rhetoric that positions you above the team.</strong></p>

<p>Leaders that foster belief in their team are always in the fox hole so to speak, never commanding from outside of it.</p>

<p><strong>2. Never offended by the “why,” in fact welcome it.</strong></p>

<p>A manager once asked me if I had any questions after implementing a new policy on pricing for our services, if I had any questions. I replied “no,” and when I shifted my chair to leave he said, “you should always ask for the why.” Perhaps not being in the presence of effective management before, I always thought asking a manager why they are implementing a specific policy was effective and insubordinate. I expressed this view to my manager and he waved his hand and said that had no place in today’s business. He explained that the company is looking to build future leaders, and those leaders need to understand why decisions are made.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We never do things without a reason, and someday you will be sitting in my seat, then you will not just need to know why you are making a decision, but also how to teach the next generation.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only did my manager give me insight into the why of a particular decision, he also showed commitment to my own development. Leaders that do this show implicit belief in their employees to one day be ready for the career they are aiming for and not just where they are right now. Thinking of an employees future shows belief like nothing else.</p>

<p><strong>3. Delegate important tasks.</strong></p>

<p><strong>4. Encourage employees to seek answers for themselves.</strong></p>

<p><strong>5. First to take blame, last to accept praise.</strong></p>
