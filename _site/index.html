                <p>I am a creative technoligist, UX/UI designer, and frontend engineer specializing in creative website and user interface solutions. I have a wide array of experience from working with digital agencies to working with emerging SaaS marketing solutions.</p>
                <p>My journey into the world of design began in photography, in the dark room of my high school where I learned the beauty of unique composition and the simplicity of seeing the world in black and white. My passion for technology led me into the world of front-end engineering where I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and javascript. I specialize in creative technology solutions, responsive web design, and UI development for businesses large and small. I am experienced in CMS development as well as front end MVC frameworks.</p>
                <p>My expertise and passion has led me to brand myself a full-stack designer, where I can own a project end to end, and blur the line that separates the machine from the visceral.</p>

              <p>Since being an entrepreneur is my true aspiration I am going to give that a try for a while.</p>
              <p>I'm currently in the process of building my own business with my business partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abramsjustin/">Justin Abrams</a>. Unfortunately that has not left me much time to create really nice case studies or fancy slides of my projects. If you want to keep up to date with our progress check out the site at <a href="https://www.causeofakind.com">causeofakind.com</a>. I will also be blogging in the <a href="#journal">journal</a> section of this site again. Stay tuned for tech tips and hardships as we try to bring this thing into the world.</p>
              <p>Since we have no funding, no board and no offices, a guy still has to make a living. As we bootrap our startup, you can see some of my previous design and development work on <a href="https://www.behance.net/mrispoli">behance</a>. I am also presently working for <a href="https://hungryinc.com/">Hungry Inc.</a> in New York City developing some really cool web projects for clients like Seabourn and Two Trees Management Co.</p>
