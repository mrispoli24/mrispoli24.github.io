				<h2>Adaptive Vs. Responsive: The Spectrum Problem</h2>

<p>These days a common gripe that I have as an engineer is the use of the term <em>responsive</em>. The question  in meetings is always posed, <em>&quot;is your site responsive?&quot;</em> As an integrator of third party software this becomes especially challenging, since a response of <em>yes</em> from an ecom director or marketing coordinator can mean just about anything from a completely fluid layout to a completely seperate m.dot site. </p>

<p>From a designer / developer perspective the correct rhetoric would be is your site <em>adaptive</em> or is it <em>responsive</em>? However, does this really cover it? Are all sites that are <em>mobile optimized</em> sitting within one of these two predefined camps?</p>

<p>The short answer is <em>no</em>. </p>

<p>Back when I was designing and building ecommerce sites for small businesses, in my mind, I had full control. There were two options, fixed width, or a fully eloquent responsive solution. I wanted the site to move like liquid, casually filling it&#39;s container perfectly at every browser resize. Then I learned about business.</p>

<p>The fact is, you don&#39;t always get the option of a full redesign, and you don&#39;t always get the option of executing your vision fully. Other designers, often bound to the old print media model, understood little of the careful balance holding a site together across every contorsion. A responsive site like this is a unicorn, it usually requires a full redesign of the previous site, and last minute changes can leave you tearing your hair out in frustration as your beutiful liquid mercury terminator get&#39;s shredded to bits. </p>

<p>What most clients end up with, is something that works--something that makes both money and it&#39;s launch date.</p>

<h3>.The Spectrum Problem</h3>

<p>What I have found is that most <em>mobile optimized</em> sites today (and I specify <em>mobile optimized</em> because some people still forgo mobile all together) exist on a spectrum. Much like in geometery where a square is a rectangle is also a parralellogram, but not the other way around--responsive is adaptive is mobile optimized but not vice versa.</p>

<p>Now many designers and developers are already rolling their eyes, but give me a chance to help this definition along. The fact is in the wide world of web development, we encounter a schmorgasboard of hybrid solutions. If we try to define the whole of the mobile web in two camps, then we leave out the gray areas that exist, we lose the ability to speak intelligently with our clients and get the full picture to our development team.</p>

<p>But where do we begin finding out what approach was used?</p>

<h3>.Device or Window-Size Detection</h3>

<p>There are two main ways that a website decides how to adjust its layout.</p>

<p><strong>1. Device Detection:</strong> Triggers new code based upon the device being used. This can either be done by media queries in the CSS, or server side code.</p>

<p><strong>2. Window Size:</strong> Triggers based upon the size of the browser winow. This is typically done using media queries in your stylesheet, but is also achievable, though inefficient, using javascript.</p>

<p>When a site relies upon device detection, we are looking at a site firmly on the <em>adaptive</em> end of the spectrum. When we look at window size, we begin to tip towards the <em>responsive</em> end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>Take a look at the below CSS to see how this would look in standard media queries.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="css"><span class="c">/* Device Detection */</span>

<span class="k">@media</span> <span class="nt">screen</span> <span class="nt">and</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">min-device-width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">768px</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="nt">and</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">max-device-width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">1024px</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">...</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/* Window Size Detection */</span>

<span class="k">@media</span> <span class="nt">screen</span> <span class="nt">and</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">min-width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">768px</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="nt">and</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">max-width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">1024px</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">...</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Not too much of a difference there, but in terms of behavior, min/max-width will work when the browser is resized, whereas min/max-device-width requires a mobile device or simulator to trigger. For this reason device detection is often the most bothersome to work with. It also doesn not account for a user perhaps using a smaller browser window on their desktop or laptop. For the best user experience and full movement towards responsive design principles we are seeing window size detection become more popular.</p>

<p>But how do we define these terms simply?</p>

<h3>.The Spectrum Defined</h3>

<p>Going back to the geometry example, I see a few major definitions, or buzz words, each nesting within one another like Russian matryoshka dolls.</p>

<h4>Mobile Optimized</h4>

<p>This encompasses any site with even the most primitive of mobile capabilities all the way up to full on digital liquid mercury. It&#39;s just vague enough to show you have a clue where the current trends are going, but not specific enough to be presumtuous of anything ground-breaking. It shows the existance of a strategy, albeit it may be a poor one.</p>

<h4>Adaptive</h4>

<p>Adaptive design takes the approach of setting the template to shift at predetermined widths or breakpoints. Traditionally this could either be done by serving up a new template (the m.dot method) based upon device detection, or through media queries. However, today, we see this definition applied to media query method only and serving up an m.dot template becoming a solution to simply achieve the buzz word of mobile optimization. To call this approach <em>adaptive</em> would be rather disingenuous by today&#39;s standards. But even when done by media query, it can either specify device-width or simply use window-width, but the site will appear to <em>snap</em> at these breakpoints to the next layout. One can see that in the adaptive definition alone there is a spectrum, but it&#39;s beginning to narrow.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/mrispoli24/E2xsr/6/embedded/result/" target="_blank">this example</a>. I&#39;ve made the break points a bit more drastic to emphasize the effect but be sure to take a look at the margin at each breakpoint as the background color changes. The Site content <em>snaps</em> to the next width. I used the window-size detection method so you can simply resize your browser window rather than load in a device.</p>

<h4>Responsive</h4>

<p>Responsive design means that the site will <em>respond</em> to any device constraints thrown at it. It involves the use of percentages for element and font size, fluid grids, and will scale the layout according to window-width <em>not</em> device-width. This is the latest crazy in web design as it is the most forward thinking by ensuring consisten layout despite the myriad of new devices and screen sizes we see each year. Does this mean that a responsive site is not also adaptive? No, it most certainly is adaptive as it&#39;s break points are, well every point. But is an adaptive site also responsive? Not necessarily. So really these definitions begin to go from vague to more specific as we move along. </p>

<p>But I would like to add one more...</p>

<h4>Fluid Responsive</h4>

<p>This is the stuff web applications are made of, and what I consider to be the holy grail of web design. It&#39;s often not possible for more complex sites to achieve this status but it is becoming more popular with time. This is the digital liquid mercury I refer to, just pure unicorn blood. These sites will scale infinitely relying wholly on window-size detection as their responsive parent, however they will never shift layout as is common with fluid grids. They often have to maintain a single column through out, much like this blog, as two columns in a smart phone gets awful cumbersome.</p>

<h3>.For The Visually Inclined</h3>

<p><img class="elastic" src="/images/adaptive-responsive-spectrum.jpg" alt="the adaptive responsive spectrum chart"></p>

<p>These definitions in themselves do not clear up the amount of methods or combination of methods used on the web today. I have seen responsive sites down to a certain width where they swith to the m.dot method and sites that scaled all the way down to mobile using a fluid grid but when loaded into a device pull up a completely different template. Hence the need to understand this as a spectrum rather than trying to categorized every site into two distinct categories.</p>

<p>The jumble of different ways businesses have attempted to bring their site into the mobile revolution is not influenced simply by purity of development but also by cost and usage constraints. Often we like to divide things into black and white, but there is a big gray area today in the mobile web, and the sooner we recognize it, the sooner we can adapt our business practices to it.</p>
