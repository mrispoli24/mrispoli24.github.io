## Start With Semantics: Natural, Passive, Active

Back in 2001, right around the time Geocities was going out of style, I was learning to lead my first traditional rock climb outdoors. For those that don't know this is the art of taking what is called the *sharp end* and placing protective gear to catch you if you fall as you move up the wall. In other words, being the guy that goes first and puts the rope up the wall.

My uncle taught me about the three types of protection we use--natural, passive, and active. Natural pro is anything that already exists on the wall *naturally*. For example slinging a tree, or chockstone, or horn of rock. Passive protection involves the use of what are called *nuts* or *stoppers*. They are essentially pieces of metal attached to steel cable that can fit into "v-shaped" cracks. They are known as passive because they are simple machines in their function and perform no action on the rock other than being too big to fall out of the crack you place them in. Active pro, is the use of *spring-loaded camming devices* or *SLCD's*. They were a revolutionary development in rock climbing as they fit almost anywhere, able to take a load from multiple directions, and are extremely secure as they actively put pressure outward on the rock that only multiplies with greater force.

*"When you climb you want to look for natural pro first, passive second, and active last..."*

*--Uncle Jim*

Today, when teaching new climbers the craft of traditional leading, I always repeat this lesson as it still rings true for me today on any climb. It is a surefire way to maintain your most versatile gear for the longest amount of time, and keep your efficiency at it's peak.

These three types of pro can also be looked at as your basic web building tools: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The principle I learned all those years ago, I find myself applying to web development each day.

HTML being your natural pro, no web page can exist without it--it is the structural back bone of the page and also the easiest to write and render.

CSS can be looked at as your passive pro. As the presentation layer it adds life where there could just be drab text, and is also rather easy to write and fast for the browser to render.

JavaScript, your active pro, is the most versatile and also can manipulate the DOM in ways CSS and HTML cannot. At the same time it can also do everything the previous two languages can and more.

### Why Do Semantics Even Matter?
