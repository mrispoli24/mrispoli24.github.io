# Leading Through Respect: How to Cultivate Belief in your team

# Cultivating Belief in your Team

> "Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it." -- Dwight D. Eisenhower

It has become a cliche to say there are two ways to lead, one is through fear, the other is through respect. Unless you are the head of a slave labor force, or somehow find yourself running an insane asylum complete with a large indian, a stuttering momma's boy, and an Irish leatherneck--fear will never be a viable leadership strategy. The focus of this essay is respect, because many a leader has found them self pondering this cliche, all the while pondering *but how do I gain this elusive respect?* In my experience I have seen two major ways the best managers gain the respect of their workforce, and a failure to master one of these two leads the team open to a subtle mutiny.

The first is the easiest to spot and understand. This type of leader garners the respect of their team through their resume. Their prior accomplishments speak for themselves and to an outsider, they gain the respect of their team based upon where they have been. For instance if you are a designer you may ask for the opinion of your peers and weigh their opinions against your own, however if Jony Ive were to supply you with feedback you may be more inclined to follow it. If someone has been down the road you are hoping to travel, and with wild or even moderate success, you would be wise to follow their lead. However, this type of leader didn't just emerge from their mother's womb with a kickass resume that garners the respect and admiration of their peers. You would also be write to criticize as hyperbolic an example as Jony Ive. Many leaders that we work with every day have modest resumes still in their infancy. Most leaders had to learn to lead long before they were ready, and it is a common mistake to attempt to replicate the behavior of the perceived master of their trade, descending to the role of the frustrated boss rather than the calm savant they were hoping to be.

What then is the missing factor? Unwavering belief in the team itself. A team that finds itself trusted immensely and counted on becomes poised for high performance. A leader that shows belief in their team will find respect comes easy, and success frequent. More importantly it's easier to build those accomplishments when the team is behind you. No one can do it all themselves. The issue with the above is it's often easier to say "I believe in my team," than to show it. In order for the team to know it, it must be more than just said, it must permeate the fabric of the organization. It has to *feel* like a fact, not merely stated. In my own experience there are a few ways in which my favorite leaders have all shown this.

**1. Never use rhetoric that positions you above the team.**

Leaders that foster belief in their team are always in the fox hole so to speak, never commanding from outside of it. When great leaders speak to members of their team, it's always in the plural. Even in the delegation of tasks they'll talk about what *we* need done, not what *you* have to do. A great leader is their in the trenches with you, never standing on top of them shouting down. Simple rhetorical changes can convey this every day.

>Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people. -- Steve Jobs

**2. Never offended by the "why," in fact welcome it.**

A manager once asked me if I had any questions after implementing a new policy on pricing for our services, if I had any questions. I replied "no," and when I shifted my chair to leave he said, "you should always ask for the why." Perhaps not being in the presence of effective management before, I always thought asking a manager why they are implementing a specific policy was effective and insubordinate. I expressed this view to my manager and he waved his hand and said that had no place in today's business. He explained that the company is looking to build future leaders, and those leaders need to understand why decisions are made.

>"We never do things without a reason, and someday you will be sitting in my seat, then you will not just need to know why you are making a decision, but also how to teach the next generation."

Not only did my manager give me insight into the why of a particular decision, he also showed commitment to my own development. Leaders that do this show implicit belief in their employees to one day be ready for the career they are aiming for and not just where they are right now. In fact this company ranked management performance based on the number of their employees that moved on to management positions. Thinking of an employees future shows belief like nothing else, and this policy alone led management into it.

**3. Delegate important tasks.**

Sometimes leaders, especially those that have recently transitioned from individual contributor to management, continue to take on the most important and complex tasks. While you may think you are helping the team, you are conveying mistrust. It's common for leaders to have difficulty letting go of prior responsibilities and to want to see the most important tasks fulfilled to their satisfaction. The easiest way to do this if follow the mantra: *if you want something done right, do it yourself.*

>Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things. -- Peter Drucker

Unfortunately this becomes self-defeating as the quiet implication is your employees are not capable of completing work to your standard. If they can't gain your respect, then why do they deserve to give you theirs? One must give respect in order to gain it, by not trusting those following you, they will not continue to follow you for long.

The types of tasks that require great responsibility are often the most stimulating. They keep employees engaged and makes them feel like they are an important part of the process. Great employees will want to increase their value to the organization and be thirsty for more responsibility, great leaders let them have it.

**4. Encourage employees to seek answers for themselves.**

When employees feel comfortable with their leader it's natural for them to come to you at every wall they face. Unfortunately learning only occurs when working through problems not being handed solutions. In order to build a more powerful team, team members must be learning as well as be comfortable knowing where to find answers should you not be available.

>Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other. -- John F. Kennedy

>Good management is the art of making problems so interesting and their solutions so constructive that everyone wants to get to work and deal with them. -- Paul Hawken

This also builds trust with the team. By empowering team members to seek solutions and execute them you show that you trust their judgement and believe they can find the solution without you. You also cultivate a culture of knowledge sharing and initiative.

**5. First to take blame, last to accept praise.**

This last tip is also the most important. Standing in front of your team and not behind them shows more belief in your team than any of the preceding advice. A true leader is first to take the blame when things go wrong, and the last to accept praise when things go right. The best leaders at their core embody this sentiment in a natural and effortless manner.

>A good leader takes a little more than his share of the blame, a little less than his share of the credit. -- Arnold H. Glasow

>It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership. -- Nelson Mandela

When things go wrong, bad leaders get defensive of themselves and often differ blame to members of their team that were not up to the task. Great leaders take the blame, defend the team, and conduct their post-mortem's internally to not repeat mistakes. If a you ever find yourself throwing someone under the bus it threatens the entire team's trust in you. Trust takes a long time to build, but is flees quite quickly when betrayed.

>It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently. -- Warren Buffet


In the end a position of leadership will not allow you to get the opinions of every employee before making a decision. In business there is a time and a place for democracy. It is crucial that a leader be able to have faith that their team will be behind them.

>A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus. -- Martin Luther King, Jr.

Great leaders need to be able to drive the vision forward. There will always be differing opinions but the ability to create unity and trust in your decisions hinges largely on how you cultivate the respect of your team. If you already have a stellar reputation, you may find that to be enough, but the truly great leaders believe in the teams they manage even more than the team itself. A team that is believed in goes on to do great things, a team that is believed in will follow their leaders into the unknown with zeal.
